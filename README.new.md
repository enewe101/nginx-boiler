**To start developing:**

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install docker community edition and docker-compose (On mac,
   docker-compose is bundled in with docker community edition)
3. Map requests issued to `https?://*.dev` to localhost.  On mac, you can
   do this by running 

    `bin/mac-dev-localhost.sh`.

4. Have a look at dev-cheatsheet.txt for a guide on starting up and
   managing the development environment.
5. Start the development environment by doing 

		$ ./start.sh

**To setup a staging environment on a new machine do:**

1. Run this command on the target machine:
	bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enewe101/webapp-boiler/master/bin/ubuntu-setup.sh)
2. Ensure that DNS lookup of the hostname assigned to the STAGE\_HOST 
	variable in `.env.dev` will point to the staging server.
2. Have a look at the dev-cheatsheet.txt for a guid on starting up and
   managing the development environment.
3. Start the staging environment by doing 
		$ ./start.sh --stage


**To start production do:**

1. Run this command on the target machine:
		$ bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enewe101/webapp-boiler/master/bin/ubuntu-setup.sh)
2. Make secrets for authentication between services of the app by running
		$ bin/make-env.sh
   You will need to provide a passphrase.  The secrets will be stored in 
   `.env.prod.gpg`.
3. Obtain secrets from providers (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc) and
   encrypt the secrets and IDs into .keys.prod.gpg
4. Obtain an SSL certificate for the domain by running
		$ bin/letsencrypt.sh
   You may need to modify nginx's configuration and restart it to make the
   well-known file servable.  Be sure to copy the certificate and private
   key into the locations expected according to nginx's config.  Also, be
   sure to create a diffie hellman group, if not already done by that 
   script.
5. Start the production environment by doing 
		$ ./start.sh --prod
