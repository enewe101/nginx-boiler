STARTING THE DEV ENVIRONMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start up the mongodb instance within a docker, do:

	$ ./start.sh

from the root of the project.  This will take a long time the first time,
because it downloads base images, and then builds server images.  The images
are cached, and will start up quickly next time.  If you ever want to
rebuild the images from scratch (e.g. if changes are made to files in
<proj-root>/docker), then do 

	$ ./start.sh --force-recreate

Once the server dockers are started up, you can do:

    $ bin/connect.sh

To enter into the docker container in which nginx is running.
The nginx logs are located at `/var/log/nginx`

You can interact with the nginx command line tool through it's symlink under
bin:

    $ bin/nginx <subcommand>

For example, to restart the server

    $ bin/nginx restart
